# image = [
#	[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
#	[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
#	[1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1],
#	[1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1],

# This program creates a dictionary of rectangles.  The key is the upper left
# corner, stored as a tuple.  The value is the width and height of the rectangle
# The advantage of using a dictionary over a list is that the dictionary is
# independent of the algorithm used to find the rectangles, for example, searching
# from top to bottom instead of bottom to top.
